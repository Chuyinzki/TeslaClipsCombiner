# TeslaClipsCombiner

The videos saved when using a USB drive in a Tesla for Sentry Mode are typically saved in one minute intervals for the different cameras. TeslaClipsCombiner uses ffmpeg to combine the three different angles (front, right, left) to make 3 different videos.

## Getting Started

The compiled jar is in the root folder as a convenience. Double click it and a GUI will guide you through two steps. First specify the folder where the videos to be combined are, then specify the folder where you would like the videos to be placed.
